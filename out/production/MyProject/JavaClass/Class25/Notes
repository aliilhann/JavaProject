Collections Framework
    Collection framework is collection of multiple classes and interfaces which help us process the data
    efficiently and easily.
Why we should learn about it:
    -It is very flexible
    -Provide ready-made methods that we can just use
What is the syntax?
     -It is similar how we create of any class but we use <> to specify the name of the the class who's objects
     we are going to store in the class.
Issues with Collection Framework
     -Collection Framework does not work primitive data types(Solution is using wrapper classes).

Wrapper classes:
     Wrapper classes are object types for all primitive types.

Boxing:
    Converting the primitive data type to it's corresponding wrapper type.
