"this keyword":
     "this" is a keyword like "class", "void". It is used in ,many places. For example, if we have same name instance and a local
     variable , we can use "this" to explicitly refer to instance variable. We can use "this()" to call a constructor inside
     another constructor.

     Why should we learn about "this" keyword?
     1) It allows us to have same local and instance variables.
     2) If we have same code in two constructors we can reuse that code from one constructor inside another constructor by
     writing "this()".

 Inheritance:
     Inheritance is a mechanism in Java through which we can use the fields/methods of one class inside another class.
 Why should we learn inheritance?
     It allows to reduce the duplicate code.
 What is the syntax?
     We can use this feature by writing extends keyword when declaring a class.
  There are 4 types of inheritance
     1) Single inheritance:
     In single inheritance we only one parent and child class
     Employee-> Person
     2) Multilevel Inheritance
       In multilevel inheritance we have inheritance in multiple levels like we have a grandfather->father->son-> grand son

      3) Hierarchical Inheritance
        One parent class and multiple direct child classes.
      4) One child class can directly inherit from multiple parent classes.
